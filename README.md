# Cold Storage Installation Optimization (Arena DES)

This project applies **Discrete Event Simulation (DES)** using **Arena** to analyze and optimize cold storage installation processes. The goal is to identify bottlenecks, improve resource utilization, and reduce total installation time.

## 📌 Problem
Cold storage installation involves multiple interdependent processes such as loading, welding, wiring, painting, and final assembly. These processes compete for limited labor and equipment, causing congestion, delays, and inefficiencies.

## 📊 Models
Three simulation models were developed:

| Model | Description |
|------|------------|
| base_model.doe | Current system with one installation line |
| alternative1_extra_line.doe | Adds an additional installation line |
| alternative2_extra_line_supply.doe | Adds an additional line and increases part supply frequency |

## ⚙️ Methods
- Arena Discrete Event Simulation  
- Queueing and resource modeling  
- Scenario analysis (What-if simulation)  
- Comparison of throughput and system time  

## 🎯 Objective
To minimize installation time and improve throughput by evaluating different system configurations.

## 📈 Key Insight
Simulation results show that adding an additional installation line and increasing supply frequency significantly improves flow and reduces congestion.

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated
- Discrete Event Simulation (Arena)  
- Process modeling  
- Operations optimization  
- What-if analysis  
- Data-driven decision making  

This project was developed as part of a Final Year Project in Decision Science.
